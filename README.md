# TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction
In this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries
You are predicting the worldwide revenue for 4398 movies in the test file.
Note - many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may seem like multiple instance of a movie may appear in the data, however they are different and should be considered separate movies. In addition, some movies may share a title, but be entirely unrelated.

E.g. The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010. Also, while the Frozen (id: 5295) released by Disney in 2013 may be the household name, don't forget about the less-popular Frozen (id: 139) released three years earlier about skiers who are stranded on a chairlift...
